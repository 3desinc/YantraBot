Notes for RaspiRobot3
- for installation, you can use python3 - sudo python3 setup.py install
For installation, I would recommend python 3, as it appears to set the
directory properly whereas python2 does not.

for the board setup it looks a little like this
  L     R
[G][V][V][G]
to have them both go forwards.
